## TECHNICAL PATHWAY

### Smart Contract Development Best Practices

We will be following through the [Smart Contract Development Best Practices](https://yos.io/2019/11/10/smart-contract-development-best-practices/#use-a-development-environment) guide. This will help us learn key concepts and tools to build sophisticated decentralized application architectures. 

Start by familiarizing yourself with some of these ideas, installing Truffle and Ganache, and the Static Analysis Tools. 

There is a large toolset we'll need to learn so don't get too worried about using it all off the bat - just start getting familiar. 

If you want to code, go to [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) - a fun interactive tutorial if you want to do some more codin' - and some of the tutorials on [studio.ethereum.org](https://studio.ethereum.org/). These abstract a lot of the complexity of the tools we'll use so we can easily write, compile, deploy and interact with contracts quickly - good for learning, less for engineering. 

We also have some people learning Vyper, so if you're more familiar with Python and want to learn this pythonic language (which compiles to EVM-compatible bytecode, just like Solidity does), do it! Let's talk it all over in the `#labs-engineering` channel in Slack.
