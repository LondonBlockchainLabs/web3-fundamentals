## TECHNICAL PATHWAY


## QUESTIONS

- What is the different between an identifier and an identity? 
- What is a thing? What is an asset? What is an object? All of these must be identified ...
    - Physical objects (like a rock or a plant) vs conceptual objects (like a number or a PDF or an idea)
    - "Hard" vs "soft" associations / identification. "https://google.com" identifies something without ambiguity. "Empiricism" identifies a concept or idea, but different interpretations can still be valid. "Formal" and "informal" identification? 
    - Is the symbol 3 an identifier? What does it identify?
