# 1: TRUST



_Web3 Fundamentals_


Welcome to the Web3 Fundamentals course. This first week will start with some key readings to familiarize you with Web3, start to establish definitions of key terms and expose you to some of the thinking that led to the creation of these consensus technologies. 

Each time someone goes through this course, we'd like to improve it.  To achieve this, we need your feedback. We're creating a form, to be posted on Slack. While you're reading, please make note of:
- key insights, passages and criticisms
- links to other things you find that are relevant to the reading
- whether or not the reading should be retained.

It is expected that all Web3 Fundamentals participants complete the Core Readings. We also have two pathways, one for people with a strong technical understanding of computing, and one for those who want to gain that understanding through the course. 

We will be discussing the course in the #web3-fundamentals channel on Slack asynchronously (which means future students will be able to see the questions and answers of prior cohorts). We'll also be meeting weekly for a discussion group - details forthcoming.

## QUESTIONS

- What is trust? What is is not? What is distrust? Does trust only exist between people? 
- Why do we believe that our banks will hold our money safely? What happens if they don't? 
- How is trust built? How is it eroded?
